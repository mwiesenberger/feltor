FELTOR (Full-F ELectromagnetic code in TORoidal geometry) is both a
numerical library and a scientific software package built on top of it.

Its main physical target are plasma edge and scrape-off layer
(gyro-)fluid simulations. The numerical methods centre around
discontinuous Galerkin methods on structured grids. Our core level
functions are parallelized for a variety of hardware from multi-core cpu
to hybrid MPI{plus}GPU, which makes the library incredibly fast.
Note that the library ships with a multitude of test and benchmark programs.

== 1. Quick start guide [[sec_quickstart]]
This guide discusses how to setup, test and benchmark the FELTOR library
installation. Please read it before you proceed to the https://feltor-dev.github.io/user-guide[user guide] to learn how to use the library in your own programs.
We also present how to use the FELTOR software package,
which requires additional external libraries to be installed on the system.
____
If you run into trouble during the setup, there is a chance that we already know of the problem and have an entry in <<sec_troubleshooting,troubleshooting>> page.
If you cannot find a solution there, please inform us of the issue.
____
____
The first part assumes a Linux operating system. If you want to work
on Windows, jump to <<sec_windows,Using Feltor on Windows>>.
____

=== System setup

Open a terminal and clone the repository into any folder you like

[source,sh]
----
git clone https://www.github.com/feltor-dev/feltor
----

You also need to clone https://github.com/nvidia/thrust[thrust] and
https://github.com/cusplibrary/cusplibrary[cusp] distributed under the
Apache-2.0 license. Also, we need Agner Fog's https://github.com/vectorclass/version1[vcl] library (Apache 2.0). So again in a folder of your choice

[source,sh]
----
git clone https://www.github.com/nvidia/thrust
git clone https://www.github.com/cusplibrary/cusplibrary
git clone https://www.github.com/vectorclass/version1 vcl
# We need to checkout an older version of thrust compatible with cusp
cd thrust
git checkout 1.9.3
----

____
Our code only depends on external libraries that are themselves openly
available.
 We use version1 of the vectorclass library, as version2 requires C{plus}{plus}-17 and does not work with the intel compiler.
____

.System requirements [[tab_requirements]]

[cols='3,10,14',options="header"]
|=======================================================================
|    | Minimum system requirements  | Recommended system requirements
| *CPU*     | Any         |support for AVX and FMA instruction set
| *Compiler*| gcc-5.1 or msvc-15 or icc-17.0 (C{plus}{plus}-17 standard)| gcc-9.3, OpenMP-4 support, avx, fma instruction set flags
| *GPU*     | - | NVidia GPU with compute-capability > 6 and nvcc-11.0
| *MPI*     | - | mpi installation compatible with compiler (ideally cuda-aware in case hybrid MPI+GPU is the target system)
|=======================================================================
____
Our GPU backend uses the
https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-zone[Nvidia-CUDA] programming
environment and in order to compile and run a program for a GPU a user
needs at least the nvcc-8.0 compiler (available free of charge) and a NVidia
GPU. However, we explicitly note here that due to the modular design of
our software a user does not have to possess a GPU nor the nvcc
compiler. The CPU version of the backend is equally valid and provides
the same functionality. Analogously, an MPI installation is only required if the user targets
a distributed memory system.
____

=== Running a FELTOR test or benchmark program

In order to compile one of the many test and benchmark codes
inside the FELTOR library you need to tell
the FELTOR configuration where the external libraries are located on
your computer. The default way to do this is to go into your `HOME`
directory, make an include directory and link the paths in this
directory

[source,sh]
----
cd ~
mkdir include
cd include
ln -s path/to/thrust/thrust # Yes, thrust is there twice!
ln -s path/to/cusplibrary/cusp
ln -s path/to/vcl
----

____
If you do not like this, you can also set the include paths in your own config file as
described link:config/README.md[here].
____

Now let us compile the first benchmark program.

[source,sh]
----
cd path/to/feltor/inc/dg

make blas_b device=cpu #(for a single thread CPU version)
#or
make blas_b device=omp #(for an OpenMP version)
#or
make blas_b device=gpu #(if you have a GPU and nvcc )
----

Run the code with

[source,sh]
----
./blas_b
----

and when prompted for input vector sizes type for example `3 100 100 10`
which makes a grid with 3 polynomial coefficients, 100 cells in x, 100
cells in y and 10 in z. If you compiled for OpenMP, you can set the
number of threads with e.g. `export OMP_NUM_THREADS=4`.
____
This is a
benchmark program to benchmark various elemental functions the library
is built on. Go ahead and vary the input parameters and see how your
hardware performs. You can compile and run any other program that ends
in `_t.cu` (test programs) or `_b.cu` (benchmark programs) in
`feltor/inc/dg` in this way.
____

Now, let us test the mpi setup
____
You can of course skip this if you
don't have mpi installed on your computer. If you intend to use the
MPI backend, an implementation library of the mpi standard is required.
Per default `mpic++` is used for compilation.
____

[source,sh]
----
cd path/to/feltor/inc/dg

make blas_mpib device=cpu  # (for MPI+CPU)
# or
make blas_mpib device=omp  # (for MPI+OpenMP)
# or
make blas_mpib device=gpu # (for MPI+GPU, requires CUDA-aware MPI installation)
----

Run the code with `$ mpirun -n '# of procs' ./blas_mpib` then tell how
many process you want to use in the x-, y- and z- direction, for
example: `2 2 1` (i.e. 2 procs in x, 2 procs in y and 1 in z; total
number of procs is 4) when prompted for input vector sizes type for
example `3 100 100 10` (number of cells divided by number of procs must
be an integer number). If you compiled for MPI{plus}OpenMP, you can set the
number of OpenMP threads with e.g. `export OMP_NUM_THREADS=2`.




=== Running a FELTOR simulation

Now, we want to compile and run a simulation program. To this end, we have to
download and install some additional libraries for I/O-operations.

First, we need to install jsoncpp (distributed under the MIT License),
which on linux is available as `libjsoncpp-dev` through the package managment system.
For a manual build check the instructions on https://www.github.com/open-source-parsers/jsoncpp[JsonCpp].
[source,sh]
----
# You may have to manually link the include path
cd ~/include
ln -s /usr/include/jsoncpp/json
----

For data output we use the
http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/[NetCDF-C] library under an
MIT - like license (we use the netcdf-4 file format).
The underlying https://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/[HDF5]
library also uses a very permissive license.
Both can be installed easily on Linux through the `libnetcdf-dev` and `libhdf5-dev` packages.
For a manual build follow the build instructions in the https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/docs/getting_and_building_netcdf.html[netcdf-documentation].
Note that by default we use the serial netcdf and hdf5 libraries alson in the mpi
versions of applications.

Some desktop applications in FELTOR use the
https://github.com/mwiesenberger/draw[draw library] (developed by us
also under MIT), which depends on
http://www.glfw.org[glfw3], an OpenGL development library under a
BSD-like license. There is a `libglfw3-dev` package for convenient installation. Again, link `path/to/draw` in the `include` folder.

____
If you are on a HPC cluster, you may need to set INCLUDE and LIB variables manually.
For details on how FELTOR's Makefiles are configured please see the link:config/README.md[config] file. There are also examples of some existing Makefiles in the same folder.
____

We are now ready to compile and run a simulation program

[source,sh]
----
cd path/to/feltor/src/toefl # or any other project in the src folder

make toefl device=gpu     # (compile for gpu, cpu or omp)
cp input/default.json inputfile.json # create an inputfile
./toefl inputfile.json    # (behold a live simulation with glfw output on screen)
# or
make toefl_hpc device=gpu  # (compile for gpu, cpu or omp)
cp input/default_hpc.json inputfile_hpc.json # create an inputfile
./toefl_hpc inputfile_hpc.json outputfile.nc # (a single node simulation with output stored in a file)
# or
make toefl_mpi device=omp  # (compile for gpu, cpu or omp)
export OMP_NUM_THREADS=2   # (set OpenMP thread number to 1 for pure MPI)
echo 2 2 | mpirun -n 4 ./toefl_mpi inputfile_hpc.json outputfile.nc
# (a multi node simulation with now in total 8 threads with output stored in a file)
# The mpi program will wait for you to type the number of processes in x and y direction before
# running. That is why the echo is there.
----

Default input files are located in `path/to/feltor/src/toefl/input`. All
three programs solve the same equations. The technical documentation on
what equations are discretized, input/output parameters, etc. can be
generated as a pdf with `make doc` in the `path/to/feltor/src/toefl`
directory.

=== Using FELTOR as a library

FELTOR's library is the *dg-library* (from discontinuous Galerkin). Note
that the library is **header-only**, which means that you just have to
include the relevant header(s) and you're good to go. For example in the
following program we compute the square L2 norm of a
function:

.test.cpp [[test_cpp]]
[source,c++]
----
#include <iostream>
//include the basic dg-library
#include "dg/algorithm.h"

double function(double x, double y){return exp(x)*exp(y);}
int main()
{
    //create a 2d discretization of [0,2]x[0,2] with 3 polynomial coefficients
    dg::CartesianGrid2d g2d( 0, 2, 0, 2, 3, 20, 20);
    //discretize a function on this grid
    const dg::DVec x = dg::evaluate( function, g2d);
    //create the volume element
    const dg::DVec vol2d = dg::create::volume( g2d);
    //compute the square L2 norm on the device
    double norm = dg::blas2::dot( x, vol2d, x);
    // norm is now: (exp(4)-exp(0))^2/4
    std::cout << norm <<std::endl;
    return 0;
}
----

To compile and run this code for a GPU use (assuming the external libraries are linked in the `include` folder as described above)

[source,sh]
----
nvcc -x cu -std=c++17 --extended-lambda -Ipath/to/feltor/inc -Ipath/to/include test.cpp -o test
./test
----

Or if you want to use OpenMP and gcc instead of CUDA for the device
functions you can also use

[source,sh]
----
g++ -std=c++17 -fopenmp -mavx -mfma -DTHRUST_DEVICE_SYSTEM=THRUST_DEVICE_SYSTEM_OMP -Ipath/to/feltor/inc -Ipath/to/include test.cpp -o test
export OMP_NUM_THREADS=4
./test
----
If you do not want any parallelization, you can use a single thread version
[source,sh]
----
g++ -std=c++17 -mavx -mfma -DTHRUST_DEVICE_SYSTEM=THRUST_DEVICE_SYSTEM_CPP -Ipath/to/feltor/inc -Ipath/to/include test.cpp -o test
./test
----

If you want to use mpi, just include the MPI header before any other
FELTOR header and use our convenient typedefs like so:

.test_mpi.cpp
[source,c++]
----
#include <iostream>
//activate MPI in FELTOR
#include "mpi.h"
#include "dg/algorithm.h"

double function(double x, double y){return exp(x)*exp(y);}
int main(int argc, char* argv[])
{
    //init MPI and create a 2d Cartesian Communicator assuming 4 MPI threads
    MPI_Init( &argc, &argv);
    int periods[2] = {true, true}, np[2] = {2,2};
    MPI_Comm comm;
    MPI_Cart_create( MPI_COMM_WORLD, 2, np, periods, true, &comm);
    //create a 2d discretization of [0,2]x[0,2] with 3 polynomial coefficients
    dg::CartesianMPIGrid2d g2d( 0, 2, 0, 2, 3, 20, 20, comm);
    //discretize a function on this grid
    const dg::MDVec x = dg::evaluate( function, g2d);
    //create the volume element
    const dg::MDVec vol2d = dg::create::volume( g2d);
    //compute the square L2 norm
    double norm = dg::blas2::dot( x, vol2d, x);
    //on every thread norm is now: (exp(4)-exp(0))^2/4
    //be a good MPI citizen and clean up
    MPI_Finalize();
    return 0;
}
----

Compile e.g. for a hybrid MPI {plus} OpenMP hardware platform with

[source,sh]
----
mpic++ -std=c++17 -mavx -mfma -fopenmp -DTHRUST_DEVICE_SYSTEM=THRUST_DEVICE_SYSTEM_OMP -Ipath/to/feltor/inc -Ipath/to/include test_mpi.cpp -o test_mpi
export OMP_NUM_THREADS=2
mpirun -n 4 ./test_mpi
----

Note the striking similarity to the previous program. Especially the
line calling the dot function did not change at all. The compiler
chooses the correct implementation for you! This is a first example of a
__container free numerical algorithm__.



=== Using FELTOR's Makefile system
In order to simplify compilation in your own project we suggest to use __Makefile__ and import the feltor configuration like so:
[source,sh]
----
device=omp # default device
FELTOR_PATH=path/to/feltor

# use Feltor's configuration
include $(FELTOR_PATH)/config/default.mk
include $(FELTOR_PATH)/config/*.mk
include $(FELTOR_PATH)/config/devices/devices.mk

INCLUDE+=-I$(FELTOR_PATH)/inc/

# See feltor/config/README for a list of all defined variables
# For example here the feltor/src/toefl project is set up
# The toefl.cpp program can be compiled in three different ways
# and each can be compiled for various device values e.g.
# make toefl device=gpu

all: toefl toefl_hpc toefl_mpi

# shared memory version using glfw, jsoncpp and netcdf
toefl: toefl.cpp toefl.h parameters.h diag.h
    $(CC) $(OPT) $(CFLAGS) $< -o $@ $(INCLUDE) $(GLFLAGS) $(LIBS) $(JSONLIB) -DWITH_GLFW -g

# shared memory version using jsoncpp and netcdf without glfw
toefl_hpc: toefl.cpp toefl.h parameters.h diag.h
    $(CC) $(OPT) $(CFLAGS) $< -o $@ $(INCLUDE) $(LIBS) $(JSONLIB) -g

# mpi version using jsoncpp and netcdf without glfw
toefl_mpi: toefl.cpp toefl.h parameters.h diag.h
    $(MPICC) $(OPT) $(MPICFLAGS) $< -o $@ $(INCLUDE) $(LIBS) $(JSONLIB)

.PHONY: clean

clean:
    rm -f toefl toefl_hpc toefl_mpi

----

=== Using FELTOR on Windows [[sec_windows]]
FELTOR has been developed mostly on Linux machines.
Recently, it has become possible to develop also on Windows
using https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/[Microsoft Visual Studio]. We here
describe how to work with FELTOR's OpenMP shared memory backend on Windows.
____
Unfortunately, the msvc compiler only supports an outdated OpenMP version so
consider a performance penalty of approximately a factor 2, when running the OpenMP backend on Windows.
____

==== Basic Setup

We suggest to install the Github desktop https://desktop.github.com.
Please clone all four of the following URLs using `File -> Clone repository...`
[source,sh]
----
https://www.github.com/feltor-dev/feltor
https://www.github.com/nvidia/thrust
# Checkout thrust to 1.9.3
https://www.github.com/cusplibrary/cusplibrary
https://www.github.com/vectorclass/version1 # local path "vcl"
----
Please also have a look at the relevant <<tab_requirements, system requirements>> Table.

==== Creating a basic FELTOR Property Sheet
In Visual Studio we suggest to create a Property Sheet for FELTOR.
The Property Sheet can then be conveniently added to any project that includes
the FELTOR library headers `dg/algorithm.h` and/or `dg/geometries/geometries.h`

* Open an existing solution in Visual Studio or create a new project with `File -> New -> Projet ...` selecting `Empty Project` in Visual C{plus}{plus}.
* In the Solution Explorer change to the `Property Manager` tab (you may have to google how to activate it if it is not there), then click on `Add New Project Property Sheet`, name it `FeltorPropertySheet.props` and save it
to a convenient location.
* Double click on `FeltorPropertySheet` (expand your solution and any of the Debug or Release tabs to find it)
** In `VC++ Directories -> Include Directories` click on `Edit` Then add the four lines
`path\to\feltor\inc`, `path\to\thrust`,
`path\to\cusplibrary` and `path\to\folder_containing_vcl`
** In `C/C++ -> Optimization -> Enable Intrinsic Functions` select `Yes (/Oi)`
** In `C/C++ -> Preprocessor -> Preprocessor Definitions` select `Edit` and
add the line `THRUST_DEVICE_SYSTEM=THRUST_DEVICE_SYSTEM_CPP` (Selects the CPU backend in FELTOR)
** In `C/C++ -> Code Generation -> Enable Enhanced Instruction Set` select `Advanced Vector Extensions 2 (/arch:AVX2)` (If your CPU supports it, of course)
* Don't forget to click `Apply` in the end.

That's it.
You can add your Feltor Property Sheet to any new project
 by switching to the `Property Manager` again:
click `Add Existing Property Sheet` and select `FeltorPropertySheet`.
____
We suggest that you generate a new project for each executable program.
____

==== Basic test
In order to test the Feltor Property Sheet let us add a source file to
 the project and compile

* In the Solution Explorer right click on `Source Files -> Add -> New Item ... -> C++ File (.cpp)`.
As an example we name it `test.cpp` and copy the contents of <<test_cpp,test.cpp>>
* Change the Platform from x86 to x64.
* Compile with `Ctrl + F5` then run the code

____
If you want to prevent the console from closing on program exit,
set `Properties -> Linker -> System -> SubSystem -> Console (/SUBSYSTEM:CONSOLE)`
in your Property Sheet.
____

==== Advanced simulation projects

Our simulation codes typically depend on jsoncpp for parameter input,
glfw3 for plotting or
netcdf-4 for file output and come with a LaTeX file containing documentation.
You will need to download these additional libraries and adapt the project
properties accordingly.

jsoncpp::

* Download and Install https://www.anaconda.com/download[Anaconda].
(to get a working python3 installation)
* In Github desktop: `File -> Clone repository...` clone `https://github.com/open-source-parsers/jsoncpp`
* Execute the file `path\to\jsconcpp\amalgamate.py`. The only way
to confirm its success is to look for a `dist` folder containing `jsconcpp.cpp`
and a folder containing two header files.
* Add `path\to\jsoncpp\dist` to `Properties -> VC++ Directories -> Include Directories`
* In the Solution Explorer Right click
 `Source Files -> Add -> Existing Item` and select `path\to\jsconcpp\dist\jsoncpp.cpp`

Glfw3::

* In Github desktop: `File -> Clone repository...` clone `https://github.com/feltor-dev/draw`
* Download and extract the Windows binaries from https://www.glfw.org/download.html
* Add `path\to\glfw-3\include` and `path\to\folder_containing_draw` to
 `Properties -> VC++ Directories -> Include Directories`
* In `Properties -> Linker -> General -> Additional Library Directories` add `path\to\glfw-3\lib-vc2015`
* Finally, in `Properties -> Linker -> Input -> Additional Dependencies` add the lines `glfw3.lib` and `opengl32.lib`
(there needs to be a newline in between!)

NetCDF::

* Download and install the `NetCDF-4.x.x-NC4-64.exe` package from https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/downloads/netcdf/index.jsp
(make sure to Check "Add netCDF to system PATH" during the installation process)
* Add `path\to\netCDF\include` to `Properties -> VC++ Directories -> Include Directories`
* In `Properties -> Linker -> General -> Additional Library Directories` add `path\to\netCDF\lib`
* Finally, in `Properties -> Linker -> Input -> Additional Dependencies` add the line `netcdf.lib`

LaTeX::
Install https://miktex.org/[MikTex] and https://texstudio.org[TeXstudio] (in that order) in order to be able to
compile the tex file(s) of the documentation.

=== Troubleshooting [[sec_troubleshooting]]
==== I get a compile error: identifier "__thrust_compiler_fence" is undefined

This is an error of the unmaintained cusp that does not like the newly
updated thrust version on github. Currently, you can either go back to
version 1.9.3 in thrust:

```sh
cd path/to/thrust
git checkout 1.9.3
```
or alternatively there is a fix in cusp that can be accessed via
```sh
cd path/to/cusplibrary
git checkout cuda10
```
== 2. Documentation

The
https://mwiesenberger.github.io/feltor/dg/html/modules.html[documentation]
of the dg library was generated with
http://www.doxygen.org[Doxygen] and LateX. You can generate a local
version directly from source code. This depends on the `doxygen`,
`libjs-mathjax` and `graphviz` packages and LateX (for equations). Type `make doc` in
the folder `path/to/feltor/doc` and open `index.html` (a symbolic link
to `dg/html/modules.html`) with your favorite browser.
Finally, also note the documentations of https://thrust.github.io/doc/modules.html[thrust]
and https://cusplibrary.github.io/[cusp].

We maintain tex files in every src folder for
technical documentation, which can be compiled using pdflatex with
`make doc` in the respective src folder.
